Publishing Random Data to Redis:

Modify the Put method to publish the byte slices to the Redis channel instead of, or in addition to, putting them in the local pool.
Ensure that data is only published if there are subscribers.
Subscribing to Random Data:

Implement a subscriber logic that listens to the Redis channel and receives byte slices.
Decide on how to handle the incoming data â€“ whether to put it directly into the local pool or have a separate mechanism for handling it.
Scaling and Load Balancing:

Implement logic to dynamically adjust the rate of data production based on subscriber demand or other metrics.
Consider how you'll balance the load across multiple producers if you have more than one instance of your application running.
Error Handling and Monitoring:

Robustly handle potential errors in the pub/sub system, including connection drops.
Enhance the monitoring to include metrics related to Redis operations, such as publish/subscribe rates and errors.
